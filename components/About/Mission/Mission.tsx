        Hi, I&apos;m Luke Sauls
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        I&apos;m a detail-oriented and adaptable software engineer with
        experience in full-stack web development. My expertise lies in building
        modern, scalable web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, Python,
        and frameworks like React and Next.js. I also have experience working
        with cloud technologies such as AWS S3 to enhance performance and
        reliability.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        I thrive on solving complex problems, collaborating with
        cross-functional teams, and delivering solutions that improve user
        experiences and drive business success. My background in team leadership
        and operational efficiency enables me to bring a unique perspective to
        technical challenges.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        Before transitioning into tech, I explored various career paths,
        searching for something that truly resonated with me. Technology and
        coding had always piqued my interest, but I wasn&apos;t sure how to take
        the first step or achieve success in the field. Finding App Academy was
        a turning point for me, it gave me the opportunity to dive headfirst
        into coding and commit fully to the journey. I fell in love with
        programming during my first project: a frontend-only weather
        application. While learning HTML and CSS, I decided to go beyond the
        curriculum at that given time and explore how to integrate JavaScript to
        make the application interactive. This experience solidified my belief
        that I could master any new technology by building, making mistakes, and
        learning through the process.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        Recently, I&apos;ve been developing a Currency Converter application
        using Angular and TypeScript, which has helped me deepen my
        understanding of these technologies. I&apos;m also exploring new
        horizons by planning a project in Java, as I continue expanding my skill
        set and challenging myself with new tools and frameworks.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
        Outside of coding, I&apos;m passionate about gaming and making
        connections with new people. Feel free to explore my projects below or
        get in touch if you&apos;d like to collaborate!
